the playlist files contain the songs that will be split and their metadata
every detail has to be put in a single line

every song has to be enclosed in parentheses, the parentheses have to be the only thing in that line
it is possible to close and open a song via ")(" though
data that is outside of parentheses is used for all of the following songs
unclosed or double closed parentheses may cause unexpected behaviour

the following syntax can be used to set the songs details
song bound:
Ti <title>		sets the songs title
St <start>		sets the songs starting time
Du <duration>		sets the songs duration
En <end>		sets the songs ending time

globally settable:
Al <album>		sets the songs album
Ar <artist>		sets the songs artist

always global:
Tn <tracknumber>	sets the tracknumber

no given data after the tag removes it
tracknumber + takes the last tracknumber and increases it

-- <ignored>		ignores the line

exaple of what this looks like:

Ar the Artists
Al their Album
(
St 00:00:00
Ti first Song
Tn +
)(
St 00:05:00
Du 00:06:00
Ti their next Song
Tn +
)
-- nothing of importance in this line
Ar another Artist
(
Ti a song
En 00:15:00
Al not their album
)(
-- tracknumber five of their album but the song of another artist
Ti not their song but their album
En 00:20:00
Tn 5
)
